# ko

A personal toolkit for me and my agents to quickly check or grab stuff — papers, posts, sheets, documents, the web — without leaving the terminal.

Each subcommand wraps the best library or API I found for that job, with the defaults I actually want baked in and only 2–3 flags exposed. Several of the APIs are paid: life is too short to do everything yourself, and at personal scale they cost a few dollars a month. Everything is equally usable by a human skimming `--help` and by an AI agent calling it from bash.

Current subcommands:

- `ko fetch` — URL → clean markdown: articles, PDFs (saved to ~/Downloads + parsed), arxiv links, dead links via Wayback. Shortcut: `ko <url>`
- `ko llm` — one-shot LLM call, stdin-aware: `ko hn item 123 | ko llm "summarize"`
- `ko exa` — semantic web search + URL → markdown (via [Exa](https://exa.ai))
- `ko arxiv` — arxiv search + paper-to-markdown
- `ko hf` — Hugging Face [paper pages](https://huggingface.co/papers): daily feed, semantic search, metadata, markdown (no auth)
- `ko hn` — Hacker News top stories, search, comment trees (via [Algolia](https://hn.algolia.com/api); no auth)
- `ko doc` — PDF/Office/image → plain text (via [liteparse](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/liteparse/); local, fast, no models)
- `ko x` — search recent X posts (via the official [XDK](https://docs.x.com/xdks/python/overview); needs a paid API tier for reads)
- `ko tv` — movie/TV quick check: rating, overview, where to stream (AU default; via [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org))
- `ko tt` — TickTick lists + tasks (read-only) via its hosted MCP — `ko tt lists`, `ko tt items <list>`
- `ko gsheets` — read **& write** Google Sheets via OAuth (`get`/`find` · `set`/`put`/`header`/`add-tab`/`new`/`clear`, with overwrite guards)
- `ko gdocs` — read **& write** Google Docs (same OAuth token): `get`/`info` · `append`/`replace`/`new`
- `ko cal` — Google Calendar agenda + quick-add (same token): bare `ko cal` = next 7 days · `day`/`find`/`add`/`cals`
- `ko gmail` — read Gmail (read-only, same token): bare = recent inbox · `search "<gmail query>"` · `from <who>` · `view <id>` · `thread <id>` (whole conversation)
- `ko agent` — pydantic-ai agents: `research` (web + papers + HN) and `tv` (what to watch in AU), with saved/resumable sessions
- `ko prompt [name]` — kickoff briefs: my "how I build X" notes, pulled by name to load into an agent or copy-paste. Bare lists; `ko prompt <name>` prints. Add your own in `~/.config/ko/prompts/*.md`
- `ko models` — list model strings usable with `-m` (incl. the live OpenRouter catalog)
- `ko publish` — scaffold a site (static / markdown / Hono worker, optional PIN gate) and deploy it to Cloudflare; `ko publish preview` runs it locally first
- `ko doctor` — every tool's setup status (keys, binaries, auth) — run this first

## Install

```bash
uv tool install kotools     # or one-off, no install: uvx kotools
```

The package is `kotools`; the command it installs is **`ko`**. Run `ko doctor` first to see what's set up.

**For development** (editable clone):

```bash
uv tool install --editable /path/to/kotools   # or: uvx --from /path/to/kotools ko --help
```

## API keys

Keys live in environment variables (shell profile or `.env`) or in `~/.config/ko/config.toml` under a `[keys]` table (env always wins) — never in the repo. `ko doctor` shows each key's source (env / config / missing). What you need depends on what you use; most of ko works with no keys at all.

| Env var | Used by | Paid? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EXA_API_KEY` | `ko exa`, agents | 💰 | Search $7/1k requests (contents for 10 results included); standalone contents $1/1k pages. [exa.ai](https://exa.ai) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `ko agent` (default), `ko llm` | 💰 | One key, any model. Default agent model is `openrouter:z-ai/glm-5.2`; `-m` overrides. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `ko llm` (default), `ko agent tv` | 💰 | `ko llm` default is `google:gemini-3.5-flash` (`-m`/`KO_DEFAULT_MODEL`); also the `tv` agent's default. |
| `X_BEARER_TOKEN` | `ko x` | 💰 | X API v2 Bearer Token. Reads need a paid tier (free is ~write-only). [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com) |
| `TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `ko tv` | free | v4 Read Access Token from [TMDB settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). |
| `TICKTICK_API_KEY` | `ko tt` | (TickTick sub) | TickTick app → Account → MCP → generate. Read-only here. |
| — (Google OAuth) | `ko gsheets` | free | Not a key: one-off browser consent, token cached locally. See below. |
| — | `ko arxiv`, `ko hn`, `ko hf`, `ko doc` | free | No auth at all. |

## Google Sheets setup (one-off) — read & write

`ko gsheets` runs as *you* against *your* Google account (OAuth user flow, no service account). One
token grants read **and** write; reads use the narrower read-only scope under the hood.

1. **Create a Google Cloud project.** https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate
2. **Enable the APIs** you'll use. APIs & Services → Library → enable *Google Sheets API*, plus
   *Google Docs API* (`ko gdocs`), *Google Calendar API* (`ko cal`), and *Gmail API* (`ko gmail`,
   read-only). No Drive — `ko` works by ID and can't browse your Drive. One token covers them all.
3. **Configure the OAuth consent screen** (APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen). This step decides
   whether your refresh token lasts:
   - **Workspace org?** Set **User type: Internal** — only your org's users, and **no token expiry**.
   - **Personal Gmail (no org)?** User type must be **External**; add **yourself as a Test user**.
     ⚠️ An External app left in *Testing* expires its refresh token after **7 days** (re-auth weekly).
     To avoid that, **Publish** the app (consent screen → Publish — for a personal Desktop app you can
     ignore Google's verification; "unverified app" is just a warning you click through).
4. **Create OAuth credentials.** Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID → **Desktop app**. Download the JSON.
5. **Save the JSON** to `~/.config/ko/google_client.json` (or set `KO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_FILE=<path>`).
6. **Run `ko gsheets auth`.** A browser opens; approve. The refresh token caches at
   `~/.local/state/ko/google_token.json` (relocatable via `KO_STATE_DIR`).

**Reuse on other machines:** that token file is portable — copy it to another machine's same path (or
point `KO_STATE_DIR` at it) to reuse the auth with no re-consent.

**Already authed read-only?** `ko gsheets auth --logout`, then `ko gsheets auth` to upgrade to read+write.

**Write safety.** `set` / `put` / `header` / `add-tab` / `new` / `clear` need the read+write grant. The
shape-aware writers **refuse to overwrite non-empty cells** (the error lists exactly which) unless you
pass `--overwrite` — including formulas that currently display blank.

**Why OAuth, not a service account?** A service account needs every sheet explicitly shared with its
email — fine for bots, tedious for a personal read/write-anywhere CLI. OAuth gives access to anything
the signed-in account can see. **Scope to one folder?** No — OAuth scopes are per-API, not per-resource;
use a service account with individual share grants if you need tighter control.

### Multiple Google accounts (work + personal)

`ko gsheets` supports several accounts — each keeps its own token, and you flip between them.

- **Pick the active account** (in priority order): `--account`/`-a` on any command
  (`ko gsheets -a personal info <id>`); the `KO_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT` env var; or `[google] account`
  in `~/.config/ko/config.toml`. Unset = `"default"` (the single-account setup above, unchanged).
- **Auth each once:** `ko gsheets -a work auth` then `ko gsheets -a personal auth`. Tokens cache
  per account — `google_token_work.json`, `google_token_personal.json` (the `default` account keeps
  the legacy `google_token.json`). `ko gsheets accounts` lists them (`*` = active).
- **OAuth client (the subtle bit).** One Desktop client can authorize *multiple* accounts, so usually
  a single `~/.config/ko/google_client.json` is all you need — just auth each account into it. The
  exception: if your **work** account is a Workspace org with an **Internal** consent screen, that
  client can't authorize a **personal** Gmail (and vice-versa). Then give that account its own client
  from a separate GCP project, saved as `google_client_<account>.json` (e.g. `google_client_personal.json`);
  `ko` uses the per-account file if present, else falls back to the shared `google_client.json`.
- **Set your usual default** with `[google] account = "work"`, and reach for `-a personal` now and then.

## Output conventions

- **Default output is human-readable** and designed to pipe (`ko gsheets get` emits TSV, `ko arxiv search` emits short line format).
- **`--json` everywhere** structured data would help. Agents should prefer `--json`.
- **Errors go to stderr.** Empty results are not errors — exit `0` with a friendly message.
- **Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` runtime error (auth, network, API), `2` usage error.

## Dev

```bash
cd kotools
uv sync
npm install            # pinned wrangler for `ko publish` (needs Node; via fnm/nvm/etc.)
uv run pytest          # offline by default; KO_LIVE_TESTS=1 enables live-API tests
uv run ko --help
```
